                <p class="mt-10 pl-2 pr-2"> Always on the lookout for what's out there, what lies beyond, the reasons and workings behind things, curiosity is a core fiber in everyone at PocketAd. We make it a point to nurture curiosity in our day to day, as it creates the conditions for innovation and helps us handle uncertainty and keep our inventiveness sharp.</p>

                <p class="mt-10 pl-2 pr-2"> Light on our feet, we strive to be as nimble as possible, ready to pivot as we incorporate new information. That reflects on the       freshness of the work we deliver, on how we organize our teams, and how we approach   everything from hiring to exploring new spaces.</p>

                <p class="mt-10 pl-2 pr-2">Before anything else, PocketAd is an ecosystem. We have always had clarity about the fact that we are a part of something bigger, and that we nurture from it every bit as much as it is our responsibility to take good care of our surroundings. The only way to be consistent in our effort to co-create the future, is to also create the conditions for that future to be a better version of today.</p>
